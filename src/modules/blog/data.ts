    title: 'Building a Test Pyramid with React and Cypress',
    summary: `Learn how to structure your testing strategy in React using the Test Pyramid concept. Start with fast and focused unit tests to cover individual components, followed by integration tests for component interactions. Finally, use Cypress for end-to-end (E2E) tests to simulate real user experiences. We provide practical examples for each layer, showcasing testing libraries like Jest and @testing-library/react for unit and integration tests, and Cypress for E2E tests. By adopting this pyramid-shaped approach, you can maintain a balance between comprehensive testing and efficient test execution, ensuring the reliability of your React applications.`,

    title: 'Structuring a Scalable React Application',
    summary: `In this blog, we've explored best practices for structuring a large React application using the Context API for state management while incorporating business entities into the folder structure. We've emphasized the importance of a well-organized project layout, breaking down components into entity-specific folders, and utilizing context providers and consumers to manage state. By adopting this structured approach, you can enhance maintainability and scalability, create entity-specific components and services, and seamlessly integrate them into your routing. These practices enable efficient development and collaboration, ultimately resulting in a robust and organized codebase tailored to your project's needs.`,
